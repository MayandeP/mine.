            "honey I choose you every day, and I’m so lucky you choose me, too." ❤️
            Each day with you is a wonderful addition to my life's journey. I can't wait for forever together.
            You are the perfect woman for me—my everything, i am so happy with you,  I love you.<br>
            No other woman in the world can hold a candle to your beauty, charm and kindness
            I can't tell you what a privilege it is to fall asleep next to such a strong, stunning, and intelligent woman.
            It only took one look for me to know we belong together. I'm so happy you're mine, sweetheart.
            Counting down every moment until you're back in my arms. See you soon, my love.
        </p>
